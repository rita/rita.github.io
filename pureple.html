        <p>
          I started this project in the summer of 2019 between semesters at Georgia Tech. Because I had little experience with UX concepts and wanted to have more practice outside of what I was doing in my internship (which was mostly graphic/visual design work), I picked up <i>The Elements of User Experience</i> by Jesse James Garrett during my lunch breaks and started thinking about how I could improve my work with a better understanding of user-centered design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to study and redesign an existing app rather than create an app concept from scratch. Because I had no design or UX mentor at the time, it was easier for me to see and apply the concepts I read about when I had a launched product already in front of me. I didn't have to worry about stakeholders or my GPA being affected by this project; I was free to investigate the strategy behind every design decision and build upon an already established framework of information and content. But best of all, it gave me the opportunity to analyze and learn from other people's mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was not intended to be a fully comprehensive case study; I was unable to test my final design and my user research was limited to the reviews people left in the App Store. I still lacked a lot of knowledge and experience -- but it was a start. What began as a passion project fueled by my interest in fashion (and frustration with picking outfits for work in the morning) turned into an opportunity to expand my skillset and get myself thinking about design on more than just an aesthetic level.

        <p>
          Pureple is an outfit planning mobile application that allows users to digitize their closet, generate clothing combinations, and give style recommendations to others in the fashion community. Although user reviews recognize several useful aspects of the app, there are some pain points regarding the layout of the interface and ease-of-use for many of the main features. Users donâ€™t think the in-app interactions are reliable enough to refer to on a regular basis.

            <h5>Area of Improvement #1: Inconsistent Branding</h5>
            <p>
              The app's website has not been updated since 2016, and while the app itself gets periodic updates neither the logo nor the visual interface are consistently represented across the two platforms. The logo, consisting of a mark and the brand in a modern sans-serif font, is nowhere to be found on the website, which features a logotype in a rolling script font instead. Within the app interface itself, there are several visual issues that make it clunky and difficult to use: low contrast, improper whitespace, but most importantly the lack of any information hierarchy within the tabs, menus, and options.
            </p>
            <p>
            I recreated the logo with bolder, rounder lines that would scale better in different sizes and contexts. I also incorporated a pureple gradient background that could also be used for an iOS app background, [as consistent with brand guidelines or whatever]

          <div class="item pureple-caption">
            <h5>Area of Improvement #2: Feature Accessibility</h5>
            <p>
              Users tended to be more interested in using the Outfits feature to generate and save sets of clothes rather than using the app as a digital catalog only. While users do have to use the Wardrobe tab to add individual clothing items, it is not the feature that most would interact with when first opening the app. I personally compared it to opening the Spotify app to see an alphabetized list of every album I ever saved. A home screen where both features were available would be more user-friendly and save a click for those who had needed to tab away from Wardrobe to get started.

            <h5>Area of Improvement #3: Streamlined Cataloguing</h5>
            <p>
              When I first used the app, each clothing item had to be manually inputted one-by-one. Furthermore, you had to scroll through a long list of tags to select before you could save the item and move on. Fortunately, they have since added the function to mass-add items from your photo gallery, and the built-in photo recognition software is able to suggest what kind of clothing item it is. Tagging can be done retroactively, but you have to tap into each item to do it. An improved tagging system allowing users to tag multiple items at once would streamline the organization process.

            <h5>Area of Improvement #4: User-centric Recommendations</h5>
            <p>
              Outfits are randomly generated from one of each selected clothing type (e.g. tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories, etc), and users swipe right or left to 'like' or 'dislike' a given outfit. While 'liking' the outfit saves it in the user's Closet, 'disliking' tosses the outfit as a whole and shows the next randomly generated outfit. If the user only dislikes one piece of an outfit, there is no way to pin the items they like and swipe through items in the remaining category to find a match they might prefer more.

            <h5>Area of Improvement #5: Closet Organization</h5>
            <p>
              The two universal factors that influence users when choosing an outfit are <i>occasion</i> and <i>weather</i>, but all items are by default lumped together by type, and the virtual stylist doesn't allow the user to specify what kinds of outfits to generate. You are able to tag an outfit with <i>Winter</i> or <i>Work</i> after the fact, but frequent users who consistently need a certain type of outfit (like the <i>hesitant novice</i> and the <i>experienced fashionista</i>) would be unable to filter out irrelevant pieces. A user would not want to wear a heavy coat in the summer, nor would they want hoodies and workout pants to show up in their suggestions when they're trying to dress for work.
