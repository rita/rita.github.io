			<h2 class="project-title">Living Wage Calculator</h2>
			<h4>Information Design</h4>
			<p>This was a personal case study I did over the course of one week to practice critiquing informational artifacts and using animation software.</p>
			<p>Tools Used: Sketch, Principle</p>
      <i>This is a self-directed study of the living wage calculator found at <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu">livingwage.mit.edu</a></i>
      <h5>The Problem</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The UI is unappealing
          <p>
            The site has a brown/tan/cream color palette that looks outdated and doesn't help to establish itself as an academic source. A cleaner, more cohesive design language can help achieve a more sophisticated and reputable look. Many banking, realty, and career sites have a combination of white and one bright accent color, and it looks much cleaner and more sophisticated than this muted color palette here.
          </p>
          <img src="images/screenshot-1.png" style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>
        </li>

        <li>
          Choosing a location is unecessarily complicated
          <p>
            Instead of a series of lists, a text field with an autocomplete function would simplify the search process. Filtering by a city does not need to be separated by two steps, and the presence of a search box makes the list of choices redundant.
          </p>
          <img src="images/screenshot-2.png" style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The results are unclear
          <p>
            The site presents results to the user in the form of a chart divided by family size. There's no need to include all family size options. Adding a selection to the calculation in the screen prior would eliminate the need for the user to scan the chart to find their result.
          </p>
          <img src="images/screenshot-3.png" style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Use Cases</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Calculating a current living situation
          <p>
            Rebecca is looking for a job in Madison, Wisconsin and wants to know how much she has to make to support herself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculating a possible living situation
          <p>
            Kimberly and her significant other live together in Glendale, Arizona. They are considering starting a family soon and want to make sure they are financially ready.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Comparing a possible living situation with a current living situation
          <p>
            Mariam is currently living in Raleigh, North Carolina and is considering moving to San Diego, California to be closer to family. She wants a general idea of how her cost of living will change.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Areas of Improvement</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I updated the UI from muted browns to a cleaner theme of white and teal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Instead of separating the location user input into  a text field and the list of links, I simplified it to a text field only. Scanning the alphabetized list of locations takes more time than using a text field with an autocomplete function.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since most users won't need the results for all available family types, I added family size as a selector in the input screen to help emphasize the most relevant data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, I organized the results to reflect a sense of visual hierarchy and gave the user additional options to further personalize their results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Conflicting Metrics</h5>
      <h6>Clarity vs. Volume</h6>
      <p>
        In some cases it would be useful to see the results for multiple living situations at once. However, for the purpose of a simple calculation, it would be clearer for the user to see one result rather than multiple results as a default. Adding a <i>Compare Results</i> feature separately would mitigate this issue.
      </p>
      <h5>Sketch Explorations</h5>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>For the purposes of this exercise I adapted Karol Ortyl's <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2761602-Calories-Calculator">split-screen design</a>.</i></p>
      <img src="images/living-wage-sketches.JPG" style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>
      <h5>Final Result</h5>
