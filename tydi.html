        <h5>How might a user interface be designed to positively reinforce healthy habits?</h5>
        <p>
          Some individuals struggle with maintaining a clean living space, oftentimes as a byproduct of declining mental health and eventually leading to strained relationships with others.
        </p>
        <h4>Brief</h4>
        <p>
          Messiness is more than just a personality trait. In many cases it’s simply a habit that results from procrastination, but it may manifest in someone underprepared to maintain their own living space for the first time as well. For individuals struggling with chronic illness or mental health in particular, keeping up with household tasks can also pose a significant challenge.

He has never shared a living space with a significant other before, and because his apartment is usually pretty messy he wants to change the way he lives so his fiancee isn’t put off by his habits or stuck doing all the cleaning herself. He has tried to be more organized in the past but ends up giving up within a few weeks. Patrick wants to be a helpful and considerate partner, but he’s having a difficult time keeping track of what needs to be done and when.

                Matthew tries his best to be a good roommate by cleaning up after himself and being quiet when others are sleeping. However, he notices that his roommates aren’t cleaning the shared kitchen and bathroom on a regular basis. He’s tried to bring this up and his roommates just say they’ll catch up on the weekend, but they aren’t very consistent at doing so. Nobody in the apartment really has a set routine for dealing with housework, and Matthew doesn’t want to overstep any boundaries by telling people what to do.

      Tapping through to the options menu of a room brings up the complete task list for that room. Tasks are organized by how frequently they have to be done: daily, weekly, monthly, or seasonally. The app comes with tasks pre-loaded, but users can also edit or add additional tasks from this screen. Once a task is due, it appears in the user’s task list. Tasks for shared spaces rotate through each roommate or family member.
